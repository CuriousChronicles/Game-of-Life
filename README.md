# Game-of-Life
#This is a MATLAB project from the University of Auckland MATHS 199 course.
In this project we were given the task to create a game of life simulator
In the project brief we were given the specifications of each function we were expected to create.

Project Description:
In this project, our goal was to write a MATLAB project to search for a period-19 oscillator.

Function Descriptions:

- The gameoflife_search function takes in a nxm matrix where the entries are randomly generated in way that will hopefully find a period-19 oscillator.
-
